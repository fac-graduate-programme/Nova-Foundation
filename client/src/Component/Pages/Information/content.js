            Grief is the flipside of love, which is why it is so painful.
            Babyloss is against the natural order of things, resulting in an
            intense grief for the loss of your child and the loss of the life
            you had planned. We are so sorry that this happened to you. Please
            know that you are not alone.

            This app was designed by babyloss parents to provide comfort to

            remember your baby, whilst helping you track your own wellbeing.

            Grief can feel like drowning in a freezing sea at midnight. It can
            be overwhelming and frightening, but is always changing, along with
            the feelings that go with it. Grief has no time limit.
          </p>

            You may have heard of the five stages of grief – denial, anger,
            bargaining, depression and acceptance. These are not linear stages
            that you will neatly go though, you may experience some but not
            others, feel some again and again or feel them all at once. Grief is
            more like an upwards spiral than a staircase, you will often feel
            the same emotion, with different intensities. You will not always
            feel like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you experienced any of these feelings and how do you feel right
            now?

            Body pains - Grief can manifest itself in many ways including
            through your body. What happened to you is traumatic. You could have
            numbness (arm numbness/aching is very common with babyloss mothers).
            You may have migraines and headaches, or pain or tingling
            sensations.
          </p>

          <p>Have you had any body pains and aches and if so what are they?</p>
          <p>
            Exhaustion - In the first six weeks it is likely you will experience
            physical exhaustion, with emotional exhaustion lifting a bit by
            month three. At times you may feel like you are going mad, but
            memory loss is very common, often made worse by headaches, and,
            although it can be frightening, is nothing to be alarmed about.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may feel numb, have difficulty concentrating, have a loss of
            appetite, poor sleep etc. At points you may feel pure despair and an
            intense sadness. This is natural.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guilt is a common reaction to babyloss. Guilt can feel like a
            prison. Please know that nothing you said, did, ate, read caused you
            to lose your baby. You are not to blame, it was not your fault.
            Please let people look after you treat yourself kindly as you would
            treat a friend.
          </p>
          <p>What nice things are you going to do to look after yourself?</p>
          <p>
            Image result for svg volcanoAnger – this could be at the hospital,
            at the world, at other people for saying well meaning but silly
            things, at yourself. Feeling life is meaningless, that life is
            unjust and good people have bad things happen to them, at wanting
            answers and having none. It is perfectly natural to feel angry about
            what happened, it is a feeling and will pass. Talk to someone about
            how you feel. Take time to breathe and respond to people that may
            upset you, calmly. Journal your feelings. Get your anger out in a
            way that feels good for you but that does not impact other people.

            What symptoms of grief have you experienced and how do you think you
            could let the anger out?

            Depression – Grief and depression are two very different things.
            They can have similar symptoms such as poor sleep, lack of appetite
            and feeling intensely sad. The sting of grief lessens over time,
            whereas depression does not. Depression is an illness that can be
            treated, whereas grief subsides over time. If your feelings do not
            change in the first few months, or if you are unsure if what you are
            feeling is grief or depression, please go to your GP.

            Trauma – trauma is your normal bodies reaction to an abnormal event.
            There are many crossovers between trauma and grief. The main
            symptoms of trauma include anxiety, replaying images or moments in
            your mind/flashbacks, being triggered, nightmares, unexplained
            pains, feeling fearful, tinglings or numbness in your body (arm
            pain/ache is very common for babyloss mums), feeling
            disconnected/detached, being on edge all the time/jumpy and unable
            to relax, having persistent haunting and unwanted thoughts, feeling
            overwhelmed/overstimulated in public spaces, hypersensitivity to
            sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you experienced any of the above symptoms and if so, what are
            they?
          </p>
          <p>
            If you feel you are traumatised you should seek professional support
            from a trauma therapist. Trauma can be flushed out the system very
            quickly (3-4 sessions) leaving you free to focus on grieving. If you
            feel you have ptsd, use the app to track your feelings. If traumatic
            symptoms persist for four weeks please go to your GP if you find the
            wait for an appointment is too long you can go privately by googling
            trauma therapists in your area. There is additional information
            about trauma and different therapies available on our website.
